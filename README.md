# NexusPay - Industrial Grade Digital Wallet Backend

NexusPay is a high-performance, resilient digital wallet solution developed as an **Applied Java solution**. The project focuses on strict financial data integrity, transactional atomicity, and a decoupled architecture designed for scalability and maintainability.

## 🏗️ Architecture: Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)

This project implements **Hexagonal Architecture** to ensure that the core business logic remains independent of external frameworks, databases, and UI components.

* **Domain Layer:** Contains the business entities (`Account`) and core logic. It is entirely agnostic of Spring Boot or JPA.
* **Application Layer (Use Cases):** Orchestrates the flow of data to and from the domain.
* **Infrastructure Layer:** * **Incoming Adapters:** REST Controllers using DTOs (Java Records) and Jakarta Validation.
    * **Outgoing Adapters:** Persistence implementation using Spring Data JPA and PostgreSQL.

## 🛡️ Financial Integrity & Transactional Safety

The system is designed with a "Safety-First" approach for fund management:

1.  **Transactional Atomicity:** All fund transfers are wrapped in `@Transactional` proxies. If any step (withdrawal, deposit, or auditing) fails, the entire operation is rolled back, ensuring no money is ever lost in transit.
2.  **Double-Layer Validation:**
    * **Entry Level:** Jakarta Validation (`@Valid`, `@Positive`) intercepts invalid requests at the Controller level.
    * **Domain Level:** The `Account` entity enforces business rules (e.g., preventing negative balances or invalid operations) even if bypassed by upper layers.
3.  **Precision:** Uses `BigDecimal` for all monetary calculations to avoid floating-point errors common in financial systems.

## 🧪 Quality Assurance

The project includes **Integration Tests (IT)** that simulate negative paths, specifically verifying that the database integrity remains intact and rollbacks are successfully triggered when encountering invalid target accounts or system errors.

## ❓ FAQ (Interview Questions)

**Q: Why use Hexagonal Architecture instead of traditional Layered Architecture?**
A: It allows for better testability and decouples the business logic from infrastructure. We can swap the database or move from REST to gRPC without touching the core banking logic.

**Q: How do you handle concurrency in account balance updates?**
A: While currently relying on Spring's transactional management, the architecture is prepared to implement Optimistic Locking (via JPA `@Version`) or Pessimistic Locking to handle high-concurrency environments.
